## Things To Do
* Implement smart shutdown of subsystems when in risk of brownout.

We used two Xbox controllers (currently using the F310 gamepad by Logitech), one for the *driver*, who controls the movement of the robot, and one for the *shotgun*, who operates the turret, gear intake, etc.

### Driver
